ToDo
====

1. Implement AJAX call to refresh feed regularly.  
   **Problems** -   
     * ~~Access DOM through index.js to insert tweets~~  
     
   **Solution** - 
     * **None**, i.e make a separate Node.js project if needed. No need to merge both Django backend and Nodejs.

2. Try using Socket.IO for continuous updates.
